# Github Actions Workflow Test

## Build & Deploy using Rsync via SSH with Passphrase

This simple JS project was used to test the github actions workflow [seen here](https://github.com/kevin-terry/actions-npm-build-ssh-passphrase-deploy/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml). This workflow will build and deploy your project over SSH even if a passphrase is required. Awesome!
